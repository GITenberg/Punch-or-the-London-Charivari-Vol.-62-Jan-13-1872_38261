<h2>A STRAIGHTFORWARD VIEW.</h2>

<p><i>High Church Curate.</i> &quot;<span class="smcap">And what do you Think, Mr. Simpson, about a
Clergyman's Turning to the East?</span>&quot;</p>

<p><i>Literal Churchwarden.</i> &quot;<span class="smcap">Well, Sir, my Opinion is, that if the Clergyman
is Goodlookin', he don't want to Turn his Back to the Congregation!</span>&quot;</p>
</div>

<hr />

<h2>POKES IN PANTOMIMES.</h2>

<p><i><span class="smcap">Non</span> omnia possumus omnes</i>; we are not all Popes, nor
should we be omnipotent even if we were infallible. The
<i>Daily News</i> is a journal of ability; but there is a certain
inconsistency, the cause of which it declares itself unable
to fathom:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
&quot;That all personal allusions to the private lives of individuals
should be eschewed on the stage, we readily admit. Indeed,
we sympathise with <span class="smcap">Dr. Johnson</span>, who, on hearing that <span class="smcap">Foote</span>,
the actor, intended to imitate his mien and gestures, inquired
the price of a good thick stick; but why, in the name of
common sense, when caricatures of <span class="smcap">Mr. Gladstone</span> and <span class="smcap">Mr.
Lowe</span> weekly appear in humorous journals, and when scarcely a
day passes without these gentlemen being attacked in print on
account of one or other of their public acts, every harmless joke
upon their official doings should be expunged from the pantomimes,
surpasses comprehension.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p>Our excellent contemporary forgets that there is in
theatres a place called the Gallery. This place is occupied
by a peculiar description of audience and spectators.
In the theatre, by physical position, they constitute
the higher orders, but in common talk are
contrariwise named. Of old, bloated aristocrats were
wont ironically to style them &quot;the Gods.&quot; Enlightened
Statesmen, however, with a just appreciation of their
value as British voters, use to call them the People. Now
the People of the Gallery are not accustomed to read
humorous journals in which caricatures of the People's
<span class="smcap">William</span>, and the People's <span class="smcap">Robert</span>, appear weekly. If
they were, it would be necessary for the humorous
journals to be very careful in caricaturing those popular
Ministers, lest caricatures should endanger their popularity.
The People of the Gallery are our flesh and
blood, but they are as yet uneducated, and apt to take
jokes too seriously. If the <i>Clown</i> in a Pantomime were
to tread upon a match-box, and get blown up sky-high,
or if, assisted by the <i>Pantaloon</i>, he presented a working
man in an arsenal with a sack, these performances, to the
occupants of the boxes indeed, would be harmless jokes,
but the effect produced by them in the electoral way
would probably be mischievous, in a gallery filled with
friends and relations of match-venders and dockyard
labourers.</p>

<hr />

<h2>The Best Tonic.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Doctors disapprove of alcohol, but they are as
alive as ever to the cheering effect of &quot;good spirits&quot; on
their patients.</p>

<hr />

<h2>PROBABLE INTELLIGENCE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The Chancellor of the Exchequer</span>, being thoroughly convinced
of the injustice of the Income-tax, is maturing a measure for its
total abolition. To prove that he is perfectly sincere in the task he
undertakes, he has resolved to throw up office if the tax again be
voted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Ayrton</span> is engaged in studying the Fine Arts, with a view to
being able to lecture <span class="smcap">Lord Elcho</span> and others on the subject, and
also to defend the action of the Government in resisting all attempts
to improve the National Gallery.</p>

<p>In the fear lest His Holiness be forced to quit the Vatican, <span class="smcap">Mr.
Whalley</span>, M.P., has written, very generously, to offer his own
residence as an asylum for the <span class="smcap">Pope</span>, while exiled from his kingdom.</p>

<p>It is proposed, at the conclusion of the Tichborne trial, to treat
the Judge and Jury to a trip upon the Continent, in order to prevent
them from becoming monomaniacs, through having their minds
occupied so long with one subject.</p>

<p>It is considered almost certain that <span class="smcap">M. Thiers</span> will seize a very
early opportunity to vacate his seat, as President, in favour either of
the <span class="smcap">Comte de Paris</span> or of <span class="smcap">M. Gambetta</span>.</p>

<p>The game slaughtered at the <i>battues</i> of eleven noble sportsmen
(all members of the Legislature), has been carefully distributed
among the East-End poor.</p>

<p>It has been ascertained, by an accurate survey in London and the
provinces, that no fewer than one pantomime has been produced
this season, without containing any humorous allusion to &quot;the
Claimant.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Gladstone</span> has received one hundred and twelve letters, from
Peterborough, Hanwell, Colney Hatch, and other places, asking for
a confirmation of the rumour that his great-great-grandmother
embraced the Jewish faith.</p>

<p>More than a hundred noble members of the Gun Club have withdrawn
their names this season, and have transferred their subscriptions
to the Humane Society.</p>

<p>Among the measures likely to be introduced by Government
are: (1) a Bill for the Reduction of the Prices charged by Butchers;
(2) a Bill to Compel Londoners to Clean their Streets in Dirty
Weather; and (3) a Bill to Disafforest Primrose Hill and the
Brighton Cliffs and Racecourse.</p>

<p>The First Lord of the Admiralty has been taking a few lessons in
political navigation, with the view, upon emergency, of taking chief
command of the vessel of the State.</p>

<p>It is considered highly probable that, following the good example
of some Dramatic Managers, certain Barristers and Doctors in the
very highest practice intend to decorate their waiting-rooms with
little placards of &quot;<span class="smcap">No Fees</span>!&quot;</p>

<hr />

<h2>JUST A HINT.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Is</span> there not a bit of <span class="smcap">Sydney Smith's</span>, wherein that divine, describing
a Scottish rising against English tyranny, says that <span class="smcap">Sawney</span>
betook himself to the heather, and, having scratched himself with
one hand, and cast up an account with the other, suddenly waxed
furious, and drew his sword? We hope that certain Transatlantic
friends of ours will not bring in so tremendous a bill against us, as
to make it cheaper for us to fight than to pay. For we love them
very much, but we are obliged to be awfully economical in these
Gladstonian days.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Mathematical Intelligence.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> would puzzle a Senior Wrangler to find out how to square a
circle. Yet <span class="smcap">Tomkins</span> Junior says that, though he is only twelve
years old, he will back himself on any given morning to get round a
square.</p>

<h2>EVENINGS FROM HOME.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next place of Amusement to which <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span> took his two
young pupils was the <span class="smcap">Strand Theatre</span>. Here they saw <i>Arion, or the
Story of a Lyre</i>, and were highly diverted with the two Showmen,
played by <span class="smcap">Messrs. Paulton</span> and <span class="smcap">Terry</span>, whose duet of &quot;<i>Walk Up
and See my Show</i>,&quot; they so vehemently applauded as to draw forth
a reproof from their worthy preceptor, who, however, on observing
that these comedians seemed to be possessed of an inexhaustible
stock of fresh verses applicable to the circumstances of the times,
was induced to join <span class="smcap">Tommy</span> and <span class="smcap">Harry</span> in the commendations
which were most liberally bestowed by the audience upon this
portion of the performance. On returning to their lodgings both
<span class="smcap">Tommy</span> and <span class="smcap">Harry</span>, neither of whom had up to this time ever
evinced any musical capacity, attempted to recall the pleasing airs
they had heard at the Strand Theatre, and only ceased from their
praiseworthy endeavours on receiving <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow's</span> promise that
he would take them again to witness the same piece, if <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>
(whose father, being a very wealthy man, had recently bestowed
upon his son a handsome Christmas gratuity) would pay for three
stalls, or at least three places, in the Dress Circle.</p>

<hr />

<p>On the following night they went to the <span class="smcap">Princess's</span>, to see <span class="smcap">Mr.
Watts Phillips's</span> play of <i>On the Jury</i>, followed by a Pantomime
called <i>Little Dicky Dilver</i>.</p>

<p>At the entrance to the Stalls a civil person relieved them of their
overcoats and hats; and <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>, upon whom his tutor's example,
on the occasion of their visit to Drury Lane, had not been lost,
expressed his gratitude to the honest stranger in the most affectionate
manner.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tommy</span> now discovered a further opportunity of making himself
acquainted with the science of Astronomy, which he had already set
himself diligently to learn.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Barlow.</i> At this theatre you will behold a constellation of
talent.</p>

<p><i>Tommy.</i> But pray, Sir, what is a &quot;constellation&quot;?</p>

<p>&quot;Persons,&quot; answered <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span>, &quot;have observed certain stars
remarkable either for their brightness or position, or both. These
stars, joined together, are termed 'constellations.' Here you have
three Stars&mdash;<span class="smcap">Mr. Webster</span>, <span class="smcap">Mr. Phelps</span>, and <span class="smcap">Miss Furtado</span>.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Tommy.</i> Then these are, as you say, Sir, &quot;remarkable for their
brightness or position.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Barlow.</i> Yes. And in time, no doubt, I shall be able to make
you acquainted with the names and the appearance of all the Stars
in London.</p>

<p><i>Tommy.</i> Sir, I am much obliged to you, indeed. But of what use
is it to know the Stars?</p>

<p><i>Mr. Barlow.</i> There are some, and those very important, uses to
be derived from an acquaintance with the Stars. <span class="smcap">Harry</span>, do you
tell <span class="smcap">Master Merton</span> the story of <i>The Free Admission and the
Grateful Turk</i>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Harry</span> was commencing the story when the curtain, being drawn
up, disclosed to them the First Scene of <i>On the Jury</i>.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Barlow.</i> This would indeed be a very good piece, but for
faulty construction. Yet, for epigrammatic dialogue and dramatic
situations, it has not, at this present moment, its equal in town.
You have been silent, <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>, for some time.</p>

<p><i>Tommy.</i> Indeed, Sir, I never was more surprised or diverted;
and as for one of your Stars, <span class="smcap">Miss Furtado</span>,&mdash;Dear Heart! I protest
I could watch her every evening with the greatest delight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span>, observing his pupil's excitement, laughed at <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>
in his usual good-natured manner, and pointed out to him the
example of the poor Greenlanders as worthy of his imitation.</p>

<p>&quot;What is that, Sir?&quot; inquired <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>.</p>

<p>&quot;They are brought up to so much moderation and self-command,&quot;
said <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span>, &quot;that they never give way to the sudden impulses
of passion so common among Europeans. And see, you have
split your new white kid gloves in applauding this young lady.&quot;
Then turning to <span class="smcap">Harry</span>, he asked him if he had not been touched
by the acting of <span class="smcap">Mr. Webster</span> in this piece.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Indeed, Sir, I pitied him from my heart. <i>Mr. Tibbetts</i>
was a hardly-used gentleman. And I think that no one could have
played more admirably than the gentleman who took the part of
<i>Dexter Sanderson, Esq.</i></p>

<p><i>Mr. Barlow.</i> You mean <span class="smcap">Mr. Phelps</span>, and you are right. It is
indeed a fine piece of acting. There is so much breadth, and
yet such a thorough finish, in this performance, that it would be
worth the while of many of our younger actors (who flatter themselves
on their consummate art, in consequence of having been
unduly praised for their few achievements) to come here and take
a lesson from <span class="smcap">Mr. Phelps</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span> added that it was a pity so excellent a piece should
be wellnigh spoiled by the introduction of a vulgar Sensation Scene,
and its construction marred by the awkward contrivance in the last
Act. He further complained that it should be thought necessary to
commence it at seven, and to supplement such an attraction, as this
ought to be, with a Pantomime.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tommy</span> and <span class="smcap">Harry</span> were not, however, of his mind upon this
point, and insisted upon stopping to see the <i>Clown</i>. They were
somewhat disappointed with the Pantomime, but professed themselves
prodigiously delighted with <span class="smcap">Mr. Lloyd's</span> scenery.</p>

<p>On coming out, an obliging official handed to them their overcoats,
wrappers, and hats. <span class="smcap">Tommy's</span> little heart was much affected
by this kindly attention; so, pulling out his purse, he poured
its contents (four bright new farthings and three peppermint
lozenges) into the honest fellow's hand, saying, &quot;Here, my good
man, take this, and Heaven bless you!&quot; It is impossible to express
the surprise of the poor man at the sight. He stared wildly round
him, and would have fallen but for the tender support of his assistant,
who imagined that his companion had lost his senses. But the
man cried out, &quot;O, <span class="smcap">William</span>, I am not mad! See what Providence
has sent us by the hands of this little angel!&quot; Saying this, he held
up the money and the lozenges. But <span class="smcap">Tommy</span> went up to them both,
and said, &quot;My good friends, you are very welcome to this: I freely
give it to you. Spend the money soberly; and, for the lozenges,
give them to your children, if you have any, or suck them yourselves
in your leisure moments.&quot; Before the entranced officials, who were
totally unaccustomed to receive such benefactions, could dry their
tears, <span class="smcap">Tommy</span> was out of sight, having followed <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span> and
<span class="smcap">Harry</span> to the door.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span> now took <span class="smcap">Master Tommy</span> and <span class="smcap">Harry</span> to <span class="smcap">Evans's</span>
Supper Rooms, to enter which place they had to pay a shilling
apiece. This troubled their worthy preceptor, who, indeed, was
painfully struck, as he informed his young friends, by the altered
aspect of the interior. <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span> explained to them that in <i>his</i>
time the room was snug, cosy, and comfortable, and only one quarter
of its present size. That <i>then</i> there were neither carpet nor tavern-like
mirrors. &quot;True,&quot; said <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span>, &quot;that all that was
objectionable in the entertainment of former days has long ere this
disappeared, and now I see there is a gallery where the &quot;opposite
sex,&quot; in very private boxes, can, like fairy sprites, sit invisible, and
listen to mortal melody. In the old time,&quot; continued <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span>,
&quot;you were welcomed by the Proprietor as a personal friend,
who would call <span class="smcap">John</span> to get the hot chop or kidneys for you at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page015" id="page015"></a>[pg 015]</span>
once, and give the order himself, returning to see if you
were comfortably served. Then the waiters flew, and
to command was to have. Now, <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>, observe I
have spoken to these waiters, and have ordered my
supper more than twenty minutes since, and it has
not appeared. See <span class="smcap">Mr. Green</span> himself&quot; (the veteran
here came up, and having affectionately greeted his dear
boys, <span class="smcap">Masters Sandford</span> and <span class="smcap">Merton</span>, wandered away
to another part of the room), &quot;he is no longer Proprietor;
he is only nominally in authority, his occupation
is, in effect, gone; he is the only connecting link
between the past and present <span class="smcap">Evans's</span>, 'retained,' to
quote his own immortal line about the lamented <span class="smcap">Von
Joel</span>, 'on the establishment, in consequence of his long
services.'&quot;</p>

<p>So affected were both <span class="smcap">Harry</span> and <span class="smcap">Tommy</span> by <span class="smcap">Mr.
Barlow's</span> discourse that they begged to be allowed to
quit a place which only aroused so much sadness in the
breast of their beloved preceptor. As they were leaving,
<span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span> paid a shilling for some refreshment which
he had taken, whereupon the waiter begged to be
remembered, which <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span>, being blessed with a
good memory, willingly consented to do. But the
waiter candidly explaining that he was expecting a trifle
for his trouble, <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span> could not refrain from
expostulating with the honest fellow on the absurdity
of such a system, and informed the boys, that, in the
old and palmy days of <span class="smcap">Evans's</span> there was no charge
for admission, and the attention bestowed on visitors
being admirable, it was a pleasure to bestow some
gratuity upon the attendants, which was always
received by the money collector at the door with a
grateful &quot;I thank you, Sir. Good night, Sir.&quot;</p>

<p>While <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span> was thus addressing <span class="smcap">Masters
Harry</span> and <span class="smcap">Tommy</span>, the waiter was summoned to a distant
quarter of the room, whereupon they ascended the
steps, and found themselves in the Piazza of Covent
Garden.</p>

<p>&quot;Farewell, <span class="smcap">Evans's</span>!&quot; said <span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span>, sadly; &quot;I
know not that I shall darken thy doors again!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What you were saying, Sir,&quot; observed <span class="smcap">Harry</span> on
their reaching their lodgings, &quot;reminds me of the story
of <i>Tigranes and the Amphibious Black</i>.&quot;</p>

<p><i>Mr. Barlow.</i> I do not think <span class="smcap">Tommy Merton</span> has
heard it.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Well, you must know, <span class="smcap">Master Tommy</span>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But <span class="smcap">Tommy</span> had gone straight up-stairs to bed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Barlow</span>, who knew the story by heart, having,
indeed, himself told it to <span class="smcap">Master Harry</span>, then took
his candle, and wishing <span class="smcap">Harry</span> a very good night,
retired.</p>

<hr />

<h2>VIÆ ANTIQUÆ.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is pleasant to make honourable mention, in <i>Mr.
Punch's</i> columns, of anything bearing the name of
<span class="smcap">Jerrold</span>. The latest appearance of this name is in
conjunction with that of <span class="smcap">Gustave Doré</span>&mdash;a household
word. Two artists have been making a pilgrimage
through London together, and each, with his own implement,
is recording his experiences, the result to be a
beautiful book, whereof an inviting specimen has
appeared. <i>Mr. Punch</i> is glad to welcome a new
memorial of Augusta Trinobantum, especially as that
city is being so rapidly &quot;improved,&quot; especially in the
parts most likely to attract the eye of <span class="smcap">M. Doré</span>, that it
will soon be all as colourless as a Boulevard or Regent
Street. If <span class="smcap">Mr. Jerrold</span> will show <span class="smcap">M. Doré</span> anything
that shall call out the power lavished on the houses in
the pictures to a certain book of <i>Contes</i>, the two will
do the good deed of apprising posterity that London was
the production of architects, and not of excessively
respectable contractors for building purposes.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Royal Clemency.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have heard, with gratification, that the remainder
of the sentence on <span class="smcap">John Poyntz Spencer</span>, who was sent
to Ireland in 1868, and who has since been immured in
Dublin Castle, is likely to be remitted. His admirable
conduct during his exile has endeared him to all, and
his return will be warmly welcomed. It will be felt that
he has amply expiated the political offence of being a
Whig Head-Centre, and we trust that an honourable
future is in store for him.</p>

<h2>SANITARY SERMONS.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width:30%;"> <a href="images/015.png"><img width="100%" src="images/015.png" alt="M" /></a></div>

<p><span class="smcap">ost</span> of our contemporaries
have lately improved an
alarming occasion with
many monitory observations
on typhoid fever.
The whole of these, however,
reducible into a few
words, may be pretty
well summed up in the
caution,&mdash;Look to your
drains. In addition, <i>Dr.
Punch</i> begs to offer a
piece of advice <i>gratis</i> to
all persons in possession
of his universal remedy,
price 3<i>d.</i>, 4<i>d.</i> stamped,
to counterfeit which is
piracy. Look to yourselves.</p>

<p>Pestiferous as is the
atmosphere of sewers, not
only do rats live, but
labourers work in it, the
former wholly, the latter
for most part with impunity.
The rodents get
acclimatised, unless it be
that instinct impels them
to take some sort of vegetable
or other preventive
of zymotic and mephitic
diseases. As for the
working-men, they smoke
pipes of tobacco almost
to a man, and as generally
prescribe for and administer
to themselves
alcohol in some one or other of its forms, commonly that of something short,
which, if asked to give it a name, we will call gin, or euphemistically, Old Tom,
not to say, dyslogistically, blue ruin, for the useless sake of pleasing the United
Kingdom Alliance; those conspirators against the potatory liberty of the subject
who hate us youth, and specially abhor <i>Punch</i>. The gin-drinking,
prevalent among the population of the slums, comes of a sense which is
medicinal, and the medicine would, in effect, be altogether salutary but for the
tendency of people to take it in over-doses.</p>

<p>Everybody knows how continually medical men are exposed to all manner of
contagion, and how very seldom they catch any disease. They, it is true, are
not in the habit of asking particularly for gin on coming out of a sick-room:
but they are accustomed to take, or do, whatsoever may be requisite to maintain
the bodily conditions which resist or expel poisonous or morbid effluvia.</p>

<p>Look to your drains, by all means; but look also to the natural gates and
alleys of the body&mdash;keep them clear, and permeable, and pervious. By what
means? Therein the patient may minister to himself if he can, or else should
inquire of his doctor, who will let him know. There is, however, a popular
panacea which he will find invariably efficacious. The prophylactic as well as
therapeutic virtues of <i>Punch</i>, of <i>Punch's Pocket-Book</i>, and <i>Punch's Almanack</i>,
are so universally known and so deservedly celebrated that any recommendation
beyond the merest reference to those powerful tonic, stimulant, and antiseptic
publications would be superfluous puffery. How much caution soever the
Faculty may recommend in prescribing alcohol in whatsoever form, they are of
unanimous opinion that nobody need hesitate to give or take any quantity of
<i>Punch</i>.</p>

<h2>FAIR PLAY FOR LOOSHAI.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is one thing worth note in the manners (or want of manners) of our
present enemies the Looshai folk. The <i>Standard</i> says that they delight &quot;in
transposition of the component parts of the names of places and chiefs. Thus,
<span class="smcap">Sook-pi-Lal</span> is often converted into <span class="smcap">Lal-pi-Sook</span>. A similar practice frequently
prevails in British India; the lower class of natives constantly substituting
Nucklow for Lucknow.&quot; Call these people savages! Why, they are as
witty as most members of the Stock Exchange. What higher flight can the
latter generally attain than the feat of calling &quot;<span class="smcap">Robinson and Thomson</span>&quot;
&quot;<span class="smcap">Tobinson and Romson</span>,&quot; or saying that <span class="smcap">Jones</span> lives at &quot;Wampton Hick?&quot;
We hope that these Orientals will be treated with as much consideration as may
be. They are none so uncivilised, as times go. Perhaps they like burlesques.</p>

<h2>CHRISTMAS BOXES FOR BEAUTY.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">A novel</span> kind of Christmas Box is suggested
by a legend which <i>Mr. Punch</i> lately beheld
in the window of a hair-dresser's shop&mdash;&quot;Presents
for Christmas.&quot; It was posted in
the midst of a variety of Chignons. A box
containing a quantity of false hair is the
Christmas-Box thereby presented to the imagination
of the passer-by. But who would offer
it to a young lady? Such a present is equivalent
to the gift of a wig. It is a Christmas-Box
or a New Year's Gift of a class in which
may be included several other articles of a
similar description, but more useful, and much
more ornamental. For instance, you might
give a friend in need, personal and pecuniary,
a Christmas-Box in the shape of a set of
artificial teeth, or the &quot;Guinea Jaw&quot; of our
friend the Dentist, or a glass eye, or a gutta-percha
nose, or a wooden leg.</p>

<p>Some of the &quot;Presents for Christmas&quot; above
referred to were Chignons which looked like
horses' tails. Others of the Chignons for
Christmas-Boxes exhibited a remarkable resemblance
to the tail of a comet, from which
eccentric luminary the idea of those prodigious
top-knots may possibly have been
borrowed. Astronomy, along with Geography
and the Use of the Globes, has long formed a
branch of female education. An intelligent
girl, fresh from boarding-school, if requested
to describe the <i>Coma Berenices</i> might, or
might not inform her questioner that it was a
celestial Chignon.</p>

<hr />

<h2>&quot;Our Wig!&quot;</h2>

<p>Among the names of possible candidates for
the Speakership was that of <span class="smcap">Mr. Samuel
Whitbread</span>, Member for Bedford. He would
be an excellent Speaker, but, as matter of
humanity, <i>Punch</i> must have opposed this selection.
Imagine a triumph of the Anti-Liquor
League, imagine the success of a Bill for
putting down Porter, and imagine a grandson
of <span class="smcap">Whitbread</span> having to say &quot;That this Bill
do pass!&quot;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">ome</span> we return from
otter-hunting. Tired,
but expecting a
&quot;Nicht wi' <span class="smcap">Ruddock</span>.&quot;
He is to be
at dinner, and a few
very intimates are
coming in the evening.
The few &quot;very
intimates&quot; have no
distance to drive&mdash;merely
a matter of
eight miles or so.</p>

<p>From my window
I hear carriages drawing
up exactly at two
minutes to seven
o'clock. Punctuality
in Cornwall is the soul
of pleasure.</p>

<p>Odd: at the last
moment I can't find
either a collar or a
white tie! &quot;Come,
Desperation, lend thy
furious hold!&quot; Rummage
in the drawers,
in the portmanteau.
Staggered. Where
can it be?&mdash;the collar,
I mean. Rummage
again. Getting hot
and excited. Ought
always to come down
to dinner calm, cool,
and collected. I shall
be the only one late,
and <i>I</i> hadn't to come
twelve miles to
dinner. No excuse except the real one,&mdash;&quot;Couldn't find my collars, or a tie.&quot; Only one
thing for it. Ring the bell, and ask servant.</p>

<p>&quot;O yes. Sir! We were changing the drawers from this room to Master's. I dessay,
Sir, they're in there.&quot; They are. Rapture!</p>

<p><i>Flash.</i>&mdash;Stirring subject for operatic and descriptive music&mdash;A Gentleman's Toilet
in Difficulties.</p>

<p><i>Next Difficulty.</i>&mdash;Drop a stud suddenly. Hear it fall close by my foot. In fact, I feel,
from some peculiar sensation <i>in</i> my foot, that it is here, on the floor, close to me. No.
Hunt for it. Can't see it anywhere. [<i>Mem.</i>&mdash;Never travel without duplicate studs.
Won't, another time.] Still stooping: feeling about the carpet. Hands getting dirty
again, hair coming unbrushed, face growing warm and red.</p>

<p><i>Flash.</i>&mdash;The stud being, as it were, an excrescence on the carpet, can be perceived by
lying on the floor, (like an Indian listening to hear if anybody's coming,) and directing
your eye in a right line. After this, clothes-brush required. Stud found at last
exactly where I thought it had been at first.</p>

<p><i>Another Difficulty.</i>&mdash;Time getting on. 7.10. <span class="smcap">Pendell</span> by this time anxious below.
Every one arrived. I picture to myself <span class="smcap">Ruddock</span> in the drawing-room, filling
up the <i>mauvais quart d'heure</i> by satirical reflections on the dandy (me) who hadn't
time enough to beautify himself for dinner.</p>

<p>I should be down now, if it wasn't for the button on my collar-band. I feel that
it's all over with it, if not touched gently. Once off, and worry will be my portion for
the remainder of the evening. And I know what is the result of attempting to pin it.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;&quot;Curses not loud, but deep.&quot; Quotation adapted to circumstances.</p>

<p><i>Last Difficulty, I hope.</i>&mdash;After treating the button with suppressed emotion, dash
at the white tie. I find myself asking myself, &quot;Why the washerwoman <i>will</i> fold it all
wrong, and starch it so that the slightest crinkle shows?&quot; I have no answer. Of course
at any other moment I could tie it at once, and have done with it; but now first one
end's too long, then the other end's too short; then, on the third trial, the middle part
somehow gets hopelessly tucked into itself, and I am pulling at it, by mistake, for one
of the ends. At last I get it something like all right, but not everything that
could be desired. Waistcoat. Coat. Handkerchief! Where's handkerchief? Where
is&mdash;... ha! Down-stairs.</p>

<p>Everybody waiting, evidently. Apology. &quot;Ah!&quot; says <span class="smcap">Pendell</span>, &quot;um&mdash;ah&mdash;now
you've come, we'll&mdash;um&mdash;&mdash;&quot; and rings the bell.</p>

<p>I recognise some of our companions out otter-hunting to-day. Galaxy, too, of
Cornish beauty, which means the darkest, brightest eyes and the clearest, freshest complexions.
Not being introduced, I look about for Old <span class="smcap">Ruddock</span>. There is an elderly
gentleman sitting at a table looking over a photograph book. This is the nearest
approach to Old <span class="smcap">Ruddock</span> that I can see. Dinner announced. I take in <span class="smcap">Miss Bodd</span>, of
Popthlanack, and follow the <span class="smcap">Trelissacs</span>, the <span class="smcap">Tregonies</span> of Tregivel, and <span class="smcap">Major
Penolver</span>, with <span class="smcap">Mrs. Somebody</span> of Somewhere. Whom <span class="smcap">Ruddock</span> takes, I don't know.</p>

<p><i>A Discovery.</i>&mdash;I am seated next to Old <span class="smcap">Ruddock</span> of Ruddock, at dinner. <span class="smcap">Pendell</span>
introduces us. A hale, hearty, elderly gentleman, with, if any expression at all, rather
a sleepy one, as if a very little over-feeding would send him into a doze.</p>

<p>Now then for a &quot;Nicht wi' <span class="smcap">Ruddock</span>!&quot;</p>

<h2>POETRY OF FACT.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the festive season of the year particularly, people commonly
complain that the newspapers are dull. Unless in exceptional years,
nothing happens of which the narration is in anywise interesting,
and the dearth of news is generally so extreme that journalists are
actually driven to fill their columns with theological controversies.</p>

<p>The dryness of grammatical details has been surmounted by the
device of putting them into metre, as in the <i>As in Præsenti</i> and the
<i>Propria quæ Maribus</i> of the Eton Latin Grammar. Might not the
contents of the Journals, in like sort, be rendered somewhat less
prosy than they sometimes are by being versified? The telegrams
would, perhaps, be peculiarly susceptible of this treatment, whereunto
they seem to lend themselves in virtue of their characteristic
conciseness, which it would enhance. The electric wire on New
Year's Day transmitted a certain message from Rome. Here it is in
the form of blank verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>The King to-day received the Ministers.</p>
<p>The Deputations Parliamentary,</p>
<p>The State's great Officers, the military</p>
<p>And the municipal authorities,</p>
<p>And other delegates. His <span class="smcap">Majesty</span></p>
<p>Thanks for congratulations did return</p>
<p>To those who tendered them, occasionally,</p>
<p>Upon the New Year's Day; and he expressed</p>
<p>His hope that, 'twixt the representative</p>
<p>Great bodies of the People and the State,</p>
<p>The concord, which the national unity</p>
<p>Doth to complete essentially conduce,</p>
<p>Would ever be maintained.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Court Circular could be rendered in heroic rhymes. As thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>The <span class="smcap">Queen</span> walked in the Castle Grounds this morn;</p>
<p>The <span class="smcap">Duke of Edinburgh</span>, <span class="smcap">Louise</span>, of Lorne</p>
<p>The Princess, and the Marquis with his bride,</p>

<p>To-day, and had an audience of the <span class="smcap">Queen</span>,</p>
<p>The Premier, after that, remained to lunch,</p>
<p>The dinner-party included <i>Mr. Punch</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Other intelligence, miscellaneous or special, could be couched in
lyrical measures. Take a specimen of a money article:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>The English funds, this blessèd day,</p>
<p class="i2">Have no fresh movement known,</p>
<p>Save of one-eighth a rise had they,</p>
<p class="i2">Which could not hold its own.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Consols so little looked alive,</p>
<p class="i2">As quoted but to be</p>
<p>At ninety-two one half, to five&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Eighths, for delivery.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>Excitement did the day throughout</p>
<p class="i2">The Railway Market thrill;</p>
<p>Shares have been briskly pushed about,</p>
<p class="i2">And prices risen still.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>A hundred thousand pounds in gold</p>
<p class="i2">Came, at the Bank, to hand,</p>
<p>And much for discount there, behold!</p>
<p class="i2">Increased was the demand.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Police reports also could be embodied in song, as, for example:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>At Worship Street came <span class="smcap">Peter Fake</span>, a young thief,</p>
<p>Charged with stealing a watch, unto summary grief.</p>
<p>For three months, with hard labour, committed was he,</p>
<p>And well whipped, in addition, was ordered to be.</p>
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<p>The prisoner, on hearing his sentence, no doubt</p>
<p>More than he had expected, burst instantly out</p>
<p>In a howl, of a sort which description would mock;</p>
<p>In the midst of it he was removed from the dock.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>And so on. The suggestion above exemplified will perhaps be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page021" id="page021"></a>[pg 021]</span>
adopted by some enterprising journalist, prepared to
afford the necessary remuneration to competent poets.
In the event of another war, the communications of Our
Special Correspondent might fall naturally into the form

<h2>THE SPEAKER.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> announcement that the present <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> of the
House of Commons is about to take his well-earned
pension and Peerage, and that the election of a successor
will be one of the first Acts of Parliament when
it meets in February, has occasioned much writing in
newspapers and conversation in the social circle, in
competition with the Temple of Justice, Clubs for
Working-Men, the State of the Streets, and the &quot;insobriety&quot;
which accompanies the festive season.</p>

<p>As some misconception appears to prevail regarding the
<span class="smcap">Speaker's</span> exalted office, especially amongst the young
and gay, and in rural districts, <i>Mr. Punch</i>, the best
&quot;Popular Educator&quot; has (with the valuable assistance of
<span class="smcap">Sir Erskine May</span>) compiled a few notes on the subject,
which in his leisure moments he hopes to be able to
expand into a voluminous treatise, worthy to take its
place by the side of <i>Enfield's Speaker</i>, or anybody
else's.</p>

<p>The office of Speaker is as old as the Saxon Wittenagemot,
but the mace now borne by the Serjeant-at-Arms
is not the one which <span class="smcap">Cromwell</span> impetuously
called a &quot;bauble.&quot; That interesting relic of a bye-gone
age is said to be in a private collection in the United
States.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> is in the Chair whenever the House is
not in Committee. If it be asked, when is the House
in Committee, the answer is simple&mdash;whenever the
<span class="smcap">Speaker</span> is not in the Chair.</p>

<p>The young and the gay and the country population
have been led astray by the <span class="smcap">Speaker's</span> misleading title[A]&mdash;the
fact being that the <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> does not speak, except
on very rare occasions.</p>

<p class="note">[A] <i>Lucus a non lucendo.&mdash;Sil. Ital. de Arbor.</i>, <span class="smcap">xv.</span>, 1019.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> hears all the speeches which are made
during the time he is in the Chair, <i>for he must never
sleep while on duty</i>; but as most of those who have filled
the office have lived on, Session after Session, we may
hope that they did not consider themselves bound
<i>always</i> to listen. Even, however, with this relaxation,
the poor composition, the defective grammar, the arid
statistics, the threadbare quotations, the hesitations, the
repetitions, the bad delivery, the awkward action, the
wrong emphasis, <span class="smcap">Mr. Denison</span> must have heard and
seen through fifteen long years, cannot but have caused
him untold suffering. It seems almost incredible that
there should be any competition for the horrors of such
a post.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> has a salary, a secretary, a chaplain,
a counsel, a residence, and an allowance for keeping the
Mace in order. When he retires, he has a peerage and
a pension, and is allowed to take his Wig and Gown
and Chair away with him.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Speaker</span>, although not one of the commoner sort,
is the first Commoner in the land.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> is entitled to many privileges. He can
show friends (not exceeding four at a time) over both
Houses of Parliament without an order from the Lord
Chamberlain; he can take books out of the Library on
leaving a small deposit; he can call a wherry and go on
the river whenever he pleases; every tenth cygnet born
between Lambeth and London Bridge is his by prescriptive
right; and he is at liberty to charge the Consolidated
Fund with the cost of any refreshment he may
require during official hours, and with all cab fares to
and from the House.</p>

<p>The most terrible exercise of the Speaker's authority
is when he &quot;names&quot; a Member. The miserable man
is committed to the Tower for life, and allowed no
book to read but <i>Hansard</i>; his estates are forfeited to
the Crown, and once a year, on the day when he committed
the offence for which he was &quot;named,&quot; he is
taken by the Constable of the Tower in a tumbril to
Westminster, to beg pardon of the <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> and the
House on his knees.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> may be either a bachelor, a married man, or a widower, but
he must be one of the three.</p>

<p>If a new Member shows any eccentricity in his dress, manners, speech, or
general deportment, the <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> asks him to tea, and quietly points out to
him the impropriety of which he has been guilty.</p>

<p>At 2 <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>, at a moment's notice, without any opportunity of consulting authorities,
the <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> may be called upon to state what was the practice of the
House in the reign of <span class="smcap">Edward the Third</span>, or to remember a precedent established
during the time <span class="smcap">Sir Thomas More</span> filled the office, or to enforce a
Standing Order coëval with the Long Parliament.</p>

<h2>BRAVO! BUMBLE.</h2>

<blockquote>
&quot;At a meeting of the Bury Town Council this week, it was stated that an address was
about to be presented to Her Royal Highness the <span class="smcap">Princess Louise</span> of Hesse, by way of a
public appreciation of her exertions on behalf of His Royal Highness the <span class="smcap">Prince of
Wales</span>. It was also stated that it was proposed to present a cabinet, containing the photographic
likenesses of those signing the address&mdash;Sheriffs and other officers in their
respective uniforms, and Mayors of boroughs in their robes.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">A more</span> interesting gallery of portraits it would be difficult to imagine,
especially, if, as the encouraging words, &quot;and other officers&quot; incline us
to hope may be the case, the macebearers, beadles, and town-criers, with
possibly a selection from the police, are included in the cabinet. Perhaps it
would not be advisable to admit Sheriffs' officers. A fac-simile autograph
underneath each photograph, with the addition of the writer's usual formula
of subscription&mdash;&quot;Yours truly,&quot; &quot;Ever faithfully yours,&quot; &amp;c.&mdash;would
materially enhance the value of the present. Everyone, who can appreciate
good taste, in combination with retiring modesty, must be struck with
this, the latest outburst of corporate zeal; and the impression such a delicate
attention as the offering of a cabinet containing the likenesses of some
of the most remarkable characters of their time, will produce upon foreign
nations, already full of admiration of our loyalty and envying us our Mayors,
cannot fail to be most gratifying to the nation's vanity.</p>

<h2>SURPRISING A CASTLE.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> least ancient and least interesting part of Warwick Castle
has been burned. Subscriptions are tendered in aid of a restoration.
Question is raised whether <span class="smcap">Lord Warwick</span> should accept these, lest
the public should consider that by subscribing it acquires a certain
right in the Castle, and that the Earl's legend will have a second
meaning, when affixed over the new buildings: <i>Vix ea nostra voco</i>.
The suggestion is unworthy and sordid. <i>Mr. Punch</i> would like to
see a vote of the Commons in aid of the subscription for conserving
about the noblest relic left to us. He would be glad to say to the
Earl, in <span class="smcap">Lord Warwick's</span> own words in the Temple Garden, after a
certain rose-plucking,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p>&quot;This blot that they object against your House</p>
<p>Shall be wiped off in the next Parliament.&quot;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The cool idea that giving a nobleman help to rebuild entitles one
to walk into his property, is concentrated cheekiness; and if castles
are capable of astonishment, <i>Mr. Punch</i> would again quote W. S.
to the Earl, and say, &quot;Your Castle <i>is</i> surprised.&quot;</p>

<hr />

<h2>Dirt! Dirt! Dirt!</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> have all been taught to tread the path of duty, but some of
us seem to have forgotten the lesson. May we entreat Commissioners,
Boards, Corporations, Vestries, Parochial Authorities,
indeed, any responsible and rate-levying body which has got into
bad ways, to do their duty to our paths; and if not this winter,
perhaps the next&mdash;or, not to be too exorbitant, the next after that&mdash;to
keep the pavements and the roadways passably clean? It
would be a satisfaction to those of us who have reached middle age
to think that we may yet live to see the streets of London, and
other wealthy towns and cities, rather less lutulent than country
lanes and rural roads. When will the scavenger be abroad?</p>

<h2>THE SICK MAN IN THE VATICAN.</h2>

<blockquote>
&quot;It is stated that <span class="smcap">Victor Emmanuel</span> sent <span class="smcap">General Pralormo</span> to the
Vatican on New Year's Day to wish the <span class="smcap">Pope</span> the compliments of the season
on behalf of His Majesty. On arriving there, he was informed by <span class="smcap">Cardinal
Antonelli</span> that the Holy Father was indisposed, and could not, therefore,
receive him personally. The Cardinal undertook to deliver the compliments
of the King, and the General left. A few hours after, the <span class="smcap">Pope</span> was completely
recovered, and held his usual receptions.&quot;
</blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> faithful should congratulate the <span class="smcap">Pope</span> upon his rapid, almost
miraculous recovery. From the moment the wicked King's emissary
was out of the precincts of the Vatican, the symptoms became more
favourable, and the Court physicians were released from their
attendance. We notice, only to dismiss it with scorn, an impression
which appears to exist that the Holy Father was &quot;indisposed,&quot; in the
primary sense of the word, as worldly sovereigns have been before
now; for it is not for an instant to be supposed that a Cardinal
would put forth, and a Pope sanction, any excuse which was not in
accordance with the strictest truth.</p>

<h2>Theological News.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">His Grace</span> the <span class="smcap">Duke of Somerset</span>, some time First Lord of the
Admiralty, has come out as a writer on theology. Needless to say
that he is not ceremonious in his treatment of eminent persons. He
is by no means complimentary to the Apostles. His teaching may
be condensed into his own motto, <i>Foi pour Devoir</i>, translated
subtly. In these days everybody seems ready to instruct us in
religion&mdash;except the Bishops.</p>

copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by

this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check

before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
